# G4_Experiments

This repository contains scripts and files that will hopefully make it easy to understand how an experiment using the 4th generation Reiser panel system can easily and flexibly be created and run. While these example scripts will not demonstrate every feature of the G4 system, it will demonstrate some of the most common use cases of the system. Please let me know if there are any issues with these scripts or if there is a use case you'd really like to see demonstrated here that isn't already.
